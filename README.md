# Covid-Data-Analysis
This was a group project where we were given COVID-19 data which covered the period from Jan. 22, 2020 to May 2, 2021, and we were to work together to create various queries in Scala/Spark to find trends and other information from that data, and then turn that data into various visualizations.
